### ADC
TL ADC owns the Class C airspace in the TL CTR (Extends to 7NM from the thresholds of Runway 01/19) from `SFC` to `A015`. This airspace is designed to facilitate Helicopter Traffic and Ciruit Traffic.

## Flow
### Local Knowledge
- Aircraft may be assigned the Papa STAR to reduce track miles
- During VMC by day, aircraft may be instructed to track for a visual base to either runway
- With RWY 01 in use, small non-jet aircraft may be processed to RWY 07 via either a VSA or RNP

### Flow Tables
The tables below give an estimated time **in minutes** from the **Feeder Fix** to the **Threshold**.

#### Corrections

| Situation | Correction |
| ----- | ----- |
| Assigned a reduced speed | +1 min, *except ^* | 
| Over 40kt of head/tailwind component | +1 min for headwind<br>-1 min for tailwind |

#### Assumptions
- Nil wind
- The feeder fix for all STARs is the waypoint coinciding with the title of the STAR, except:
    - The feeder fix for the IGIKI STAR is 36 DME TL (where it intersects with the STAR track)

The following calculator will generate a landing time from a feeder fix ETA, or the reverse.

## Coordination
### Enroute
#### Departures
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Tracking via a Procedural SID terminus; and  
- Assigned the lower of `F180` or the `RFL`

All other aircraft going to TBP CTA must be **Heads-up** Coordinated by TL TCU prior to the boundary.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**TL TCU** -> **TBP**</span>: "JST729, with your concurrence, will be assigned `F160`, for my separation with QLK327D"  
    <span class="hotline">**TBP** -> **TL TCU**</span>: "JST729, concur `F160`"  

#### Arrivals
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- With ADES **YBTL**; and  
- Assigned a STAR; and  
- Assigned `A090`

All other aircraft coming from TBP CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated to TL TCU.

### ADC
#### Airspace
TL ADC owns the Class C airspace in the TL CTR from `SFC` to `A015`.

#### Auto Release  
[Next](../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is **not** required from TL ADC to TL TCU for aircraft that are:  

- Departing from a runway nominated in the ATIS; and  
- Assigned the standard assignable level; and 
- Assigned a **Procedural** SID 

The Standard Assignable level from TL ADC to TL TCU is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| ------ | ------- |
| All | The lower of `F180` and `RFL` |
