## Airspace
AD ADC is not responsible for any airspace by default.

## Maneuvering Area
### Maneuvering Area Responsibility
**ADC** is responsible for the **E2** and **D2** taxiways

!!! note
    Where an aircraft will be taxiing via multiple taxiways of the same lettering (e.g. A6, then A5, then A4, etc), refer to the taxiway by only the letter.  

    E.g. an aircraft taxiing from the terminal to runway 05 could be instructed to taxi "*via Alpha, cross runway 30, Foxtrot, to holding point Foxtrot Six runway 05*".

## Local Procedures
### Scenic Coastal Flights
VFR aircraft may transit the control zone tracking coastal north or southbound, generally at `A005`. **AD TCU** is responsible for ensuring these aircraft remain separated from aircraft arriving/departing at YPAD and will likely delegate this responsibility to **ADC**, who may employ visual separation or other tools to ensure separation is maintained.  

The TCU controller will coordinate these aircraft with ADC prior to issuing airways clearance, including the intended clearance limit. On receipt of this coordination, ADC should consider any possible conflict from arriving or departing aircraft at YPAD (including the missed approach to runway 23).  The clearance limits in the table below will ensure that coastal aircraft remain clear of the runway 05 approach path and runway 23 departure/missed approach path. 

| Direction of Travel | Clearance Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Northbound | BTJ |
| Southbound | HNLY |

!!! phraseology
    *CNY is a VFR Cessna 172 tracking coastal northbound, approaching PNL. They have contacted AD TCU for clearance.*    
    <span class="hotline">**TCU** -> **ADC**</span>: "South of PNL, CNY, for coastal northbound, 500ft, clearance limit BTJ"  
    <span class="hotline">**ADC** -> **TCU**</span>: "CNY"

If a delay is expected at the clearance limit, instruct the aircraft to hold there.

!!! phraseology 
    **CNY:** "Adelaide Tower, CNY, maintaining not above 500ft"  
    **AD ADC:** "CNY, Adelaide Tower, hold at the clearance limit, expect onwards clearance in 5 minutes due inbound traffic"  
    **CNY:** "Hold at the clearance limit, CNY"  

Once the conflict is no longer a threat (or if no holding was required in the first place), cancel the clearance limit and issue onwards clearance tracking coastal north/southbound at the desired level.

!!! phraseology 
    **AD ADC:** "CNY, cancel clearance limit, track coastal offshore northbound, not above 500ft"  
    **CNY:** "Cancel clearance limit, track coastal offshore northbound, not above 500ft, CNY"

Once the aircraft is clear of potential conflict with YPAD (i.e. north of HNLY or south of BTJ), transfer them back to AD TCU.

## Runway Modes
### Preferred Runway Modes
Winds must always be considered for Runway modes (Crosswind <20kts, Tailwind <5kts), however the order of preference is as follows:

| Priority - Mode | Arrivals  | Departures |
| ----------------| --------- | ---------- |
| 1 - 2312A23D    | 23 & 12   | 23 |
| 2 - 0512A05D    | 05 & 12   | 05 |
| 3 - 23 Only     | 23        | 23 |
| 4 - 05 Only     | 05        | 05 |
| 5 - 12 Only     | 12        | 12 |
| 6 - 30 Only     | 30        | 30 |
| *Curfew (RRO)   | 05        | 23 |

*Permitted between the hours of 2300 and 0600 Local (1330-2030 UTC/1230-1930 UTC HDS). If the pilot does not want to participate in curfew mode operations, the controller must accommodate this request.

## SID Selection
Jet Aircraft planned via **AVDEN**, **BENDO**, **GILES**, **AREPA**, **ORBUN**. or **UPROT**, shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint. Jet Aircraft **not** planned via any of these waypoints shall receive amended routing via the most appropriate SID terminus, unless the pilot indicates they are unable to accept a Procedural SID.

!!! example
    Jet Aircraft planned via AVDEN, assigned runway 23, shall be given the AVDEN SID.

a) Non-Jet Aircraft; or  
b) Aircraft using Runway 12/30; or  
c) Aircraft that cannot accept a Procedural SID  
Shall be assigned the **Radar SID**.

!!! example
    Non-Jet Aircraft planned via EEMUE, assigned runway 05, shall be given the AD (RADAR) SID.

## ATIS
### Approach Types
When **Runway 23** is in use for arrivals, the following table shall be followed for the APCH field:

| Cloud Base                | ATIS APCH field      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| At or above `A043`        | (Blank)              |
| Between `A024` and `A042` | `ACFT FM THE EAST AND JET ACFT FM THE WEST EXP INST APCH`\*  |
| Between `A007` and `A023` | `EXP INST APCH`      |
| At or below `A006`        | `EXP ILS APCH`       |

\*This allows aircraft on the Victor STAR from the west to join a visual right base without the need to conduct an instrument approach, while keeping aircraft from the east clear of the higher terrain near the Adelaide Hills.

### Operational Info
The Operational Information field should be updated based on the runway mode in use, as per the table below:

| Runway Mode  | OPR INFO Field |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Curfew (RRO) | ACST: `CURFEW IN OPERATION UNTIL TIME 2030.` <br>ACDT: `CURFEW IN OPERATION UNTIL TIME 1930.` |

## Coordination
### Auto Release
[Next](../../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is **not** required to AD TCU for aircraft that are:   

  - Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
  - Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
  - Assigned a **Procedural** SID

All other aircraft require a Next call to AD TCU.

The Standard Assignable level from AD ADC to AD TCU is:  

| Aircraft | Level |
| -------- | ----- |
| Jets | `A050` |
| Non-Jets | The lower of `A040` and `RFL` |

### Departures Controller
When **AAW** is online, the AD TCU airspace is split down the 05/23 Runway Centreline. As such, departing aircraft shall be instructed to contact the departures controller corresponding to the direction of turn of the aircraft after departure
