## Airspace
TL ADC owns the Class C airspace in the TL CTR (Extends to 7NM from the thresholds of Runway 01/19) from `SFC` to `A015`. This airspace is designed to facilitate Helicopter Traffic and Ciruit Traffic.

## Helicopter Operations
Procedures relating to Helicopters can be found in the Airforce AIP AD2 SUPPS Section for Townsville. (7.5 - 7.9)
[YBTL AD2 SUPPS Page](https://ais-af.airforce.gov.au/sites/default/files/current-ad2/2309%20Townsville%20FIHA%20AD2%20SUPP.pdf){target=new}

## Runway Modes
### Preferred Runway Modes
Runway 01/19 are the primary runways at Townsville. 
Runway 07/25 may be used in conjunction with 01/19 for VFR arrivals and Helicopter Traffic. 

### Circuits
VFR aircraft conducting circuits inside TL ADCs airspace shall be at or below `A015`. Higher circuit altitude may be given if voice coordinated with TL TCU.

#### Circuit Direction
| Runway | Direction |
| ------ | ----------|
| 01     | Left  |
| 07     | Left |
| 19     | Right |
| 25     | Right |

## SID Selection
Aircraft planned via **KVALM**, **PEWEE**, **AKROM**, **CARMN**, **ANRUB**, **CATEY**, **JEMMA**, and **WALTA** shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate SID terminus. Jet Aircraft **not** planned via any of these waypoints shall receive amended routing via the most appropriate SID terminus, unless the pilot indicates they are unable to accept a Procedural SID ending at these termini.

Aircraft that are unable to accept a procedural SID terminating on their route shall be assigned the appropriate procedural or radar SID from the table below.

| Runway | Westbound        | Eastbound       |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 01     | **TL NORTH** SID | **TL EAST** SID |
| 19     | **IGBIK** SID    | **RURTO** SID   |
| 07/25  | Visual           | Visual          |

Light and **non-RNAV** aircraft shall be assigned a visual departure.

## Coordination
### Auto Release  
[Next](../../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is **not** required from TL ADC to TL TCU for aircraft that are:  

- Departing from a runway nominated in the ATIS; and  
- Assigned the standard assignable level; and 
- Assigned a **Procedural** SID 

The Standard Assignable level from TL ADC to TL TCU is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| ------ | ------- |
| All | The lower of `F180` and `RFL` |
