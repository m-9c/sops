## Local Procedures
### City Scenic Flights
City Scenic Flights are available by day and to the west of the aerodrome. Aircraft on these routes shall be cleared at `A040`.

| YSCB Duty Runway | Route Name | Tracking Points |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ---------------- | 
| RWY 17 or 12 | CITY ROUTE CHARLIE ONE<br>CITY ROUTE CHARLIE TWO | `YSCB MTM BKM RCSE YSCB`<br>`YSCB MTM MTLR CPNG LGDA RCSE YSCB` | 
| RWY 35 or 30 | CITY ROUTE ALPHA ONE<br>CITY ROUTE ALPHA TWO | `YSCB RCSE BKM MTM YSCB`<br>`YSCB RCSE LGDA CPNG MTLR MTM YSCB` | 

!!! warning "Important"
    Controllers must update a pilot's route with the applicable waypoints and enter the coded clearance title in the **Global Ops Field**.

!!! phraseology
    **YVZ**: "Canberra Ground, YVZ, request City Route Charlie One"  
    **CB SMC**: "YVZ, cleared City Route Charlie One, climb to A040, squawk 0361, departure frequency 124.5"  
    **YVZ**: "Cleared City Route Charlie One, climb to A040, squawk 0361, departure frequency 124.5, YVZ"

## VFR Operations
VFR aircraft that will operate only in ADCs airspace shall be assigned SSR code 0040.

Aircraft operating in the circuit area are to remain on the ADC frequency. The phrasing of the airways clearance is:

!!! phraseology
    “ABC, cleared to operate in the circuit area, not above A030, squawk 0040”.

The circuit direction is not specified in the airways clearance, but with a take-off or touch-and-go clearance.

Military jet training circuits are conducted at `A035`, unless otherwise requested by the pilot. ADC shall notify the TCU of the beginning and end of the sortie.

## Helicopter Operations
The Canberra CTR contains the Southcare Helicopter Base (YXSB), the Majura Training Area (YMJR) as well as the helipad at Canberra Hospital (YXCB). Helicopters operating to and from these pads require a clearance from **CB ADC**.

### Departing Aircraft
Helicopters departing the pads require an airways clearance to do so, either taking the form of a clearance to transit the zone to the Class G airspace adjacent to the CTR (if the pilot has no intention to enter CTA) or as a normal airways clearance for a departure into the surrounding CTA. Ensure that no conflict exists with arriving or departing traffic and consider delegating separation responsibility to the VFR aircraft if required. It may also be required to coordination with the TMA controller to ensure no additional conflict exists in their sector.

Departing aircraft should **not** be issued a takeoff clearance (as the helipads are outside the manoeuvring area). Instead, instruct aircraft to 'report airborne'.

!!! phraseology
    *RSCU201 is a VFR AW139 helicopter intending to depart Southcare Base (YXSB) to the northwest at `A035` (below the base of the Class C steps).*  
    **RSCU201**: "Canberra Tower, helicopter RSCU201, Southcase Base, for departure to the northwest, A035, received Juliet, ready"  
    **CB ADC**: "RSCU201, Canberra Tower, transit approved not above A035, report OCTA"  
    **RSCU201**: "Transit approved, not above A035, RSCU201"

!!! phraseology
    *RSCU209 is an IFR AW139 helicopter intending to depart Canberra Hospital (YXCB) for Bankstown (YSBK) at `A090` (inside Class C CTA).*  
    **RSCU209**: "Canberra Tower, helicopter RSCU209, on the pad at Canberra Hospital, for Bankstown, received Juliet, ready"  
    **CB ADC**: "RSCU209, Canberra Tower, report sighting a Jetstar A320 on a 3nm final runway 35 and advise able to maintain own separation with that aircraft"  
    **RSCU209**: "Traffic sighted and affirm, RSCU209"  
    **CB ADC**: "RSCU209, pass behind the A320, maintain own separation, caution wake turbulence, cleared to Bankstown via AKMIR, flight planned route, climb to A090, squawk 3762"  
    **RSCU209**: "Cleared to Bankstown via AKMIR flight planned route, climb to A090, squawk 3762, pass behind the A320 and maintain own separation, RSCU209"  

    *Remember to pass traffic information to both aircraft.*  
    **CB ADC**: "JST619, traffic is a helicopter becoming airborne from Canberra Hospital, approximately 5nm southwest of the field, maintaining own separation with you, runway 35, cleared to land"  

### Arriving Aircraft
Helicopters arriving to the pads will generally be coordinated by the TMA controller and should be cleared via a visual approach (when available) and instructed to report on the ground. Do **not** issue a landing clearance to these aircraft (as the helipads are outside the manoeuvring area). It may be necessary to instruct these helicopters to track via amended visual points or sight and pass other aircraft.

!!! phraseology
    **RSCU203**: "Canberra Tower, gday, RSCU203"  
    **CB ADC**: "RSCU203, Canberra Tower, report sighting a Qantas 737 lining up on runway 17 and advise able to maintain own separation with that aircraft"  
    **RSCU203**: "Traffic sighted and affirm, RSCU203"  
    **CB ADC**: "RSCU203, that aircraft will be departing upwind, maintain own separation, cleared visual approach, report on the ground"  
    **RSCU203**: "Maintain own separation, cleared visual approach, RSCU203"  

    *Remember to pass traffic information to both aircraft.*  
    **CB ADC**: "QFA714, traffic is a helicopter 1nm south of the field tracking for Canberra Hospital, opposite direction to you and maintaining own separation, runway 17, cleared for takeoff"

## Runway Modes
### Preferred Runway Modes
Winds must always be considered for runway modes (Crosswind <20kts, Tailwind <5kts), however the order of preference is as follows:

| Priority - Mode | Arrivals | Departures |
| ----------------| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 - 3530A35D | 35 & 30 | 35 |
| 2 - 1712A17D | 17 & 12 | 17 |
| 3 - 17A35D (RRO) | 17 | 35 |
| 4 - 35 Only | 35 | 35 |
| 4 - 17 Only | 17 | 17 |
| 5 - 30 Only | 30 | 30 |
| 6 - 12 Only | 12 | 12 |

!!! note
    The RRO mode is most suitable for Noise Abatement. Since this is not a factor on VATSIM, it is up to you which runway mode you would like to operate, subject to winds. Consider favouring the higher capacity modes during busy times.

## SID Selection
**Jet** Aircraft planned via **CULIN**, **TANTA**, **WG VOR**, **HOWLY**, **NONUP** or **AVBEG** shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint. Jet Aircraft **not** planned via any of these waypoints shall receive amended routing via the most appropriate SID terminus, unless the pilot indicates they are unable to accept a Procedural SID.

**Non-Jet** Aircraft planned via **AKMIR** or **DUBUS** shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint.

!!! example
    Jet Aircraft planned via TANTA, assigned runway 35, shall be given the TANTA SID.

a) Jet or Non-Jet aircraft departing **Off Mode** that don't meet the above critera; or   
b) Aircraft that cannot accept a Procedural SID  
Shall be assigned the **Radar SID**.

!!! example
    Non-Jet Aircraft planned via TANTA, assigned runway 35, shall be given the CB (RADAR) SID.

## ATIS
### Significant Weather
When the crosswind component is greater than **11 kts** from the west, the ATIS SIG WX field shall include `EXP TURB OVER RWY [17/35], S OF RWY INT`.

## Coordination
### Auto Release
[Next](../../controller-skills/coordination.md#next) coordination is not required to CB TCU for aircraft that are:   
  
  - Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and  
  - Assigned the standard assignable level; and  
  - Assigned a **Procedural** SID

All other aircraft require a 'Next' call to CB TCU.

The Standard Assignable level from CB ADC to CB TCU is:  

| Flight Rules | Level |
| ------------ | ----- |
| IFR | `A100` |
| VFR | The lower of `A040` and `RFL` |

### Runway Change
Any Runway change must be prior coordinated to **CB TCU**.
